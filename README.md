# COOKIE — AI Video Production Framework

COOKIE is an AI agent framework for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) that orchestrates end-to-end video production. Tell it what you want to make, and a team of 13 specialized AI agents handles everything — scripting, storyboarding, character design, video generation, voiceover, editing, and final render. No video editing experience required.

## What You Can Make

- **YouTube videos** — explainers, tutorials, product reviews
- **Product demos** — screen recordings with narration and motion graphics
- **Social content** — short-form clips for Instagram, TikTok, YouTube Shorts
- **Brand films** — concept-driven videos with consistent characters and style
- **Educational content** — animated walkthroughs with voiceover

## Prerequisites

Install these before running setup:

| Tool | Minimum Version | Install |
|------|----------------|---------|
| Node.js | 18+ | [nodejs.org/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download) |
| Python | 3.10+ | [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) |
| uv | any | `brew install uv` or [astral.sh/uv](https://astral.sh/uv) |
| FFmpeg | any | `brew install ffmpeg` |
| Claude Code | any | `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` |

### API Keys

You'll need accounts with these services:

| Service | What It Powers | Get a Key |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Google AI Studio | VEO video generation + Gemini image generation | [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) |
| ElevenLabs | AI narration and voice synthesis | [elevenlabs.io](https://elevenlabs.io) (Settings > API Keys) |

## Installation

```bash
npx create-cookie-framework my-project
cd my-project
claude
```

The setup script will:
1. Check all dependencies are installed
2. Ask for your name and API keys
3. Install VEO skill dependencies
4. Install and start the Production Dashboard
5. Configure everything automatically

Then inside Claude Code:

```
/cookie-director
```

### Manual Setup

If you prefer to clone and set up manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/J-louage/COOKIE---AI-Video-Production-Framework.git my-project
cd my-project
bash cookie-setup.sh
```

## Quick Start

| What you want | Command | What happens |
|---------------|---------|-------------|
| Get guidance | `/cookie-director` | Activates Christy, the Director — she'll guide you |
| Make a video fast | `/cookie-quick-video` | End-to-end production from a brief idea |
| Make a social clip | `/cookie-quick-social` | Short-form video optimized for social platforms |
| Start from a concept | `/cookie-idea` | Turns your idea into a full production script |
| See all commands | `/cookie-help` | Lists every available command with descriptions |

## How It Works

### The Agent Team

COOKIE coordinates 13 specialized agents, each with a distinct role:

| Agent | Name | Role |
|-------|------|------|
| Director | Christy | Routes commands, coordinates agents, manages project flow |
| Producer | Max | Tracks costs, budgets, generates financial reports |
| Screenwriter | Nora | Writes and refines video scripts |
| Storyboard Artist | Luca | Creates Scene Specification Documents (SSDs) |
| Character Designer | Iris | Builds character identity sheets and references |
| Prompt Engineer | Zara | Generates and optimizes image/video prompts |
| Cinematographer | Orion | Manages VEO video generation |
| Voice Director | Celeste | Manages ElevenLabs voice synthesis |
| Demo Producer | Kai | Records screen captures with Playwright |
| Sound Designer | Reed | Manages music, SFX, and audio mixing |
| Motion Designer | Felix | Creates Remotion compositions and animations |
| Editor | Ava | Assembles final video, renders, exports |
| Creative Director | Nova | Brainstorms concepts, ensures brand alignment |

### The 5-Phase Pipeline

```
Ideation → Pre-Production → Asset Generation → Composition → Post-Production
```

1. **Ideation** — Start with a concept, audio, or script. Nora (Screenwriter) transforms it into a canonical script. Nova (Creative Director) reviews for quality.

2. **Pre-Production** — Luca (Storyboard Artist) creates a Scene Specification Document. Iris (Character Designer) builds character sheets. Zara (Prompt Engineer) generates all prompts. Max (Producer) estimates costs.

3. **Asset Generation** — Agents generate all assets in parallel: character references, scene frames, video clips (VEO), narration (ElevenLabs), screen captures (Playwright), and music/SFX.

4. **Composition** — Felix (Motion Designer) assembles everything into a Remotion composition with animations, text overlays, and transitions. A preview render is created for review.

5. **Post-Production** — Ava (Editor) renders the final video, generates platform-specific formats, adds subtitles, creates thumbnails, and runs the final QA checklist.

### Configuration Hierarchy

Settings cascade from global defaults to episode-specific overrides:

```
_cookie/_config/global.yaml        → Framework-wide defaults
  └ _cookie/<module>/config.yaml   → Module-level settings
    └ project-config.yaml          → Project-level overrides
      └ episodes/<ep>/episode-config.yaml  → Episode-specific overrides
```

Lower files override higher ones.

## Production Dashboard

COOKIE includes a read-only web dashboard for browsing all production data — episodes, characters, scripts, scene specs, assets, costs, agent manifests, and configuration. No database required; it reads directly from your project files.

### Starting the Dashboard

The setup script (`bash cookie-setup.sh`) installs and starts the dashboard automatically. To start it manually:

```bash
cd dashboard
npm run dev
```

The dashboard opens at **http://localhost:3000** by default.

### Running Multiple Projects

Each COOKIE project has its own dashboard. If you're working on multiple projects simultaneously, each one needs a different port:

```bash
# Project A (default port)
cd ~/projects/project-a/dashboard
npm run dev
# → http://localhost:3000

# Project B (custom port)
cd ~/projects/project-b/dashboard
PORT=3001 npm run dev
# → http://localhost:3001

# Project C (custom port)
cd ~/projects/project-c/dashboard
PORT=3002 npm run dev
# → http://localhost:3002
```

The setup script detects occupied ports and automatically picks the next available one (3000–3009).

### Restarting a Stopped Dashboard

If the dashboard was stopped or you closed the terminal:

```bash
cd dashboard
npm run dev
```

Or with a specific port:

```bash
cd dashboard
PORT=3001 npm run dev
```

To run it in the background:

```bash
cd dashboard
PORT=3000 npm run dev &
```

### Dashboard Pages

| Page | URL | What It Shows |
|------|-----|--------------|
| Home | `/` | Project stats, episode grid, budget progress |
| Episodes | `/episodes` | Episode list with status badges and progress bars |
| Episode Detail | `/episodes/[id]` | 7 tabs: Overview, Script, SSD, Style Guide, Assets, Costs, Config |
| Characters | `/characters` | Character gallery cards, brand config (colors, fonts) |
| Character Detail | `/characters/[id]` | Physical traits, voice config, prompt tokens, reference images |
| Costs | `/costs` | Budget vs actual charts, per-episode and per-tool breakdowns, pricing |
| Agents | `/agents` | 13 agents, 38 workflows by phase, 10 tasks, 8 skills, memory sidecars |
| Config | `/config` | Configuration hierarchy, resolution profiles, format presets |

### Stopping the Dashboard

If you started the dashboard in the background:

```bash
# If the PID file exists
kill $(cat dashboard/.dashboard.pid)

# Or find and kill the process
lsof -ti :3000 | xargs kill
```

## FAQ

### I ran a command but nothing happened
Make sure you're running commands inside Claude Code (the CLI), not a regular terminal. Start Claude Code with `claude` from the project directory, then type the `/cookie-*` command.

### Where are my API keys stored?
The setup script saves them to `~/.claude/.env`, which is Claude Code's standard environment file. They're loaded automatically when Claude Code starts. You can edit the file directly to update keys.

### How much does it cost to make a video?
Costs depend on the number of scenes, video clips, and narration segments. Run `/cookie-cost-estimate` after creating your Scene Specification Document to get a detailed breakdown before generating any assets. Typical short videos cost $2–10 in API calls.

### Can I use COOKIE without ElevenLabs?
Yes — narration is optional. You can create videos with just visual content and music/SFX. Skip the ElevenLabs API key during setup and the framework will work without voice synthesis.

### How do I start a new project?
Run `/cookie-director` to activate Christy, then describe your project. She'll guide you through setup. Or run `/cookie-idea` with your concept to jump straight into scriptwriting.

### How do I add characters?
Run `/cookie-create-character` to create a character identity sheet (appearance, personality, voice). Then `/cookie-gen-char-refs` to generate multi-angle reference images for visual consistency.

### How do I create social media versions?
Run `/cookie-quick-social` for rapid social clips, or `/cookie-multi-export` after a final render to generate platform-specific formats (vertical 9:16 for Reels/TikTok, square 1:1 for feed posts).

### How do I track costs?
Run `/cookie-cost-status` at any time. For a detailed breakdown, `/cookie-cost-report`. Costs are logged automatically for every API call. Set your budget in `project-config.yaml`.

### How do I extend an existing video?
Run `/cookie-extend-plan` to analyze your existing video and plan new scenes with character and style continuity.

## Troubleshooting

### Setup script fails
- Make sure you're running it from the project root: `bash cookie-setup.sh`
- Check that all prerequisites are installed (the script will tell you what's missing)
- On Linux, ensure `bash` is version 4+ (`bash --version`)

### "Command not found" for /cookie-* commands
- The `.claude/commands/` directory must exist in your project. If you cloned manually, make sure the `.claude/` directory was included.
- Run `/cookie-validate-framework` to scan for broken file references.

### API keys not working
- Verify keys are in `~/.claude/.env` (not the project `.env`)
- Check the key is correct — no extra spaces or quotes
- For Google AI: ensure the key has access to Gemini and VEO APIs at [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com)

### npm install fails in VEO skill
- Run manually: `cd _cookie/skills/veo && npm install`
- Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed: `node -v`

### VEO generation fails
- Verify model ID in config matches a valid VEO model
- Aspect ratio must be `16:9` or `9:16` — other ratios are not supported
- VEO 3.1 max clip duration is 8 seconds
- Check API key has sufficient quota

### Cost gate halts production
- Run `/cookie-cost-status` to see current spend vs. budget
- Increase budget in `project-config.yaml`
- Or switch to YOLO-UNCAPPED mode if intentional

### Character inconsistency
- Regenerate references with `/cookie-gen-char-refs`
- Check `identity.json` for correct trait descriptions
- Ensure all scenes reference the same character ID in the SSD

### Dashboard won't start
- Run `cd dashboard && npm install` to ensure dependencies are installed
- Check if the port is already in use: `lsof -i :3000` — use a different port with `PORT=3001 npm run dev`
- Verify Node.js 18+ is installed: `node -v`
- If you see "module not found" errors, delete `dashboard/node_modules` and run `npm install` again

### Remotion render fails
- Requires Node.js 18+
- Run `npm install` in the Remotion project directory
- Verify composition ID matches `src/Root.tsx`
- Check all asset file paths are valid
